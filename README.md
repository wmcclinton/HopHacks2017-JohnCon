# HopHacks2017-JohnCon

This code transforms PNGs onto a [John Conway Game of Life board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk&t=327s). The board and other files were made with Turtle graphics for Tk in Python. 

## Getting Started

Clone or download the repo recursively.

You can either include the library in your own Python script

Like this:

```
import JohnCon from JohnCon

...
```

Or you can run main.py and watch the magic

Like this:

```
python main.py
```

### Prerequisites/Installation

You will need the following python libraries: sys, turtle, random, pillow, scipy, numpy, and time. Which can all be downloaded through pip installation. 

For example:

```
sudo pip install <missing pyhton library>
```
